Installation procedure
----------------------

We will show you how to install it on Debian family Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu), and Redmine installed with aptitude, but it can works on many other distros with similar procedures.

You may need to do those commands as root, depending on your particular case.

Feel free to replace the variable $REDMINE_PATH to your own Redmine instance path.

```bash
$REDMINE_PATH=/usr/share/redmine/

cd $REDMINE_PATH/plugins/
git clone git@github.com:savoirfairelinux/redmine-list-of-roles-members.git
mv redmine-list-of-roles-members redmine_list_of_roles_members
rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
service apache2 reload  # or depending on which HTTP server you use

```

There is not further configuration needed to do after installation.
